## Empty vectors (and tibbles) for further use

To set up an empty vector, one can for instance use the following chunk of code. While doing so, the seq-function may be useful. `NA_integer_` serves as some kind of "placeholder" for figures/outcomes of formulas calculated later on.

```{r}
vector <-
  tibble(
    number = seq(
      from = 1,
      to = 10,
      by = 1
    ),
    placeholder =
      NA_integer_
  )
```
