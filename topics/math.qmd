## Math

The Integer Division Operator `%/%` performs integer division. It divides two numbers and returns the whole number part of the quotient, discarding any remainder. Example:

```{r}
10 %/% 3  # Returns 3 (quotient without remainder)
```

The Modulo Operator `%%` operator returns the remainder from the division of two numbers. Example:

```{r}
10 %% 3  # Returns 1 (remainder)
```
