## If-Else and case_when

### Basic syntax of an if-else statement

In the following, you can see the basic syntax of an if-else statement
```{r}
if (condition) {
# What should happen in case condition is TRUE?
} else {
  # What should happen in any other case?
}
```

### Applying an if-else statement within a data frame
If we want to apply an if-else statement to a specific column of a data frame, there are several ways to do so. Two possible ways are either to use the aforementioned syntax in combination with a for-loop or make use of the case_when function. The syntax is as following:
```{r}
case_when(
  column1 == "Norway" ~ "Norway",
  !column1 == "Norway" ~ "Rest of the world"
)
```
It depends on the given case what way is more convenient to use.
