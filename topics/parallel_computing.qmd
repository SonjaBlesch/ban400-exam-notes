### Parallel Computing

Here are some general steps for parallel computing:

#### DoParallel:

1.  Determine number of cores
2.  Instantiate cores
3.  Register the cluster
4.  Start timer
5.  Use foreach and %dopar%, do whatever you would have done in the regular for loop
6.  Close the clusters
7.  Stop timer

#### Furrr

1.  Use a map function to write the for loop
2.  Specify how many workers to use
3.  Start timer
4.  Use the sample loop as with the map-function but replace the map-function with the equivalent future_map-function (e.g. map2_dbl() â€“\> future_map2_dbl())
5.  Stop the timer

#### Syntax for foreach:

```{r}
#a normal for loop:
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  some calculations
}

#Foreach loop:
foreach (i = 1:nrow(df))
%dopar% 
  some calculations

#Good idea to specify how to combine results and which packages should be available to the foreach loop

```
