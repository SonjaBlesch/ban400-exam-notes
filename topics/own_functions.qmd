### Creating own functions
In R, we have the opportunity to create own functions. In order to do so, we
have to stick to the following syntax.

#### Basic syntax
```{r}
function_name <-
  function(input1, input2, input3){
    # In the following, function is defined/written
    example = (input1 + input2) * input3
    return(example) # Using return, we can exactly define function's return
  }
```

#### Anonymous functions
We can also create functions for one use only.

#### Syntax Anonymous Functions
```{r}
{\(x) content of the function}
#x is the parameter variable here
#an example for an anonymous function:
{\(x) x^3}
#don't forget the brackets () when you use it in a pipe
```
