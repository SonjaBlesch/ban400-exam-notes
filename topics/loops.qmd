## Loops and iterations

### Standard for-loop

```{r}
for(i in 1:n) {
  ... do something with i... 
}
```

Note that we can iterate over any type of vector, not just numbers, and we can give the iteration variable any name we want. In the example above it is `i`.

### While loop

Repeat until a certain condition is met. For example

```{r}
i <- 1
while(i < 10) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```
