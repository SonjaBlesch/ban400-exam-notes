## Machine Learning

### Basic structure

We dealt with Machine learning. Here are the basic steps you have to do. Steps are for the process of cross validation.

1.  Get train & testdata
2.  Make folds
3.  Define model and recipe
4.  Set up workflow
5.  Search grid
6.  Get cross validation AUC
7.  Determine "optimal" tune parameters and put them in the workflow
8.  Fit the model
9.  Predict test data
10. Calculate overall AUC
